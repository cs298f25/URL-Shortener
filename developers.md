# Development Process

We will have two separate development branches with the main branch being separate from both. 
The two development branches will be named `morro` and `aydelotte`. All new features and updates 
will be developed in their respective branches. Once a feature is complete and tested, it will be 
merged into the `main` branch after review and approval.
