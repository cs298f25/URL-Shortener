# Development Process

We will have separate branches for each new feature. Each feature branch will be created from the `main` branch. Developers will work on their assigned features in these branches. Once the feature is complete, it must be thoroughly tested locally. After testing, the feature branch will be submitted for a code review. Upon approval, the branch will be merged back into the `main` branch.
